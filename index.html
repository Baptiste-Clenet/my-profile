        <h1>What's Up? I'm Baptiste üßë‚Äçüíª</h1>
        <img src="images/profil.jpeg" class="img-circle" width="100px" alt="Baptiste Clenet">
        <p>Hey there! I'm a 20-year-old Master's student at IESEG Paris, and I'm currently rocking it as an alternate for the AVIV Group - the leading Proptech company in Europe. You've probably heard of some of their major brands like SeLoger, Meilleurs Agents, Logic Immo, and Belles Demeures.</p>
        <p>As an alternate luxury market chief, I'm all about keeping it fresh and staying ahead of the curve. My goal is to eventually make the move to product management as a junior PM. But when I'm not crushing it at work, you'll find me jamming to some house music and spinning tracks like a boss. I work with a DJ management agency in my free time, taking care of all their tours and events.</p>
        <p>So, if you're looking for a young professional with serious skills and a passion for the beat, look no further! I'm your guy.</p>

        <h2>Luxury Real Estate</h2>
        <p>As an assistant market manager for luxury brands BellesDemeures and LuxResidence, my job involves various tasks. 
          Firstly, I am responsible for keeping up-to-date with new ideas and trends on the web, such as best practices, user experiences, and products on reference websites and major online real estate sites abroad. Additionally, I collect, organize, and analyze market data, which is essential for daily marketing reflection and the implementation of our brands' semi-annual strategic plans. Furthermore, I contribute to the digital marketing efforts of our brands by collaborating on the primary KPIs of our sites, framing and executing the entire plan to acquire new clients, and assisting in designing cross-channel communication strategies for new offers and products to customers and prospects. I also assist in creating and implementing relationship campaigns, including editorial content, relationship marketing, and content animation for our professional clients. 
        Moreover, I am involved in managing digital projects, working with the market marketing team to design, develop, and launch new offers and products. Lastly, I collaborate with sales teams and coaches to create commercial documents necessary for the successful launch of our products and offers..</p>

        <h2>DJ ü§üüèΩ</h2>
        <p>I am passionate about mixing house and techno music with inspirations that date back to my parents' music taste, such as Moby and Daft Punk. Today, I draw inspiration from artists such as Keinemusik, Solomun, Peggy Gou, and Notre Dame. I particularly enjoy incorporating elements of Afro house and indie house into my sets, which gives my music a unique and eclectic feel. I am constantly exploring new sounds and experimenting with different genres, always seeking to push the boundaries of what is possible in electronic music.The beats and rhythms are so infectious and uplifting, they can turn any gathering into a dance party and create an unforgettable atmosphere.</p>
